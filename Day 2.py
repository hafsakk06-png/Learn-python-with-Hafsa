# Hello coders i hope you all  will fine and doing great
# so start our day 2 with fresh mind and fresh code
# topic of today is Variables and Data types
# so let's start
# Variables are used to store data in a program
# In Python, you don't need to declare a variable before using it
# You can simply assign a value to a variable and start using it

# integer
age = 19
print("age :", age)
print("Type of age:", type(age))

# float
pi = 3.12
print("pi value :", pi)
print("Type of pi:", type(pi))

# string
name = "Hafsa"      #you can wirte your name here
print("Name :", name)
print("Type of name:", type(name))

# boolean
is_student = True
print("Is student :", is_student)
print("Type of is_student:", type(is_student))

# so my lovely coders try try to make your own variables and print them I hope you will enjoy
# you can also change the value of a variables and see thw output
# install visual studio code and do practice it is very helpfull to learn python
# see you in next lecture
# keep learning and keep exploring
# always be happy and keep smiling
