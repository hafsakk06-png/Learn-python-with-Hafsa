# Hello everyone
# I hope you all are trying to doing good
# so my coders today is our 8th day
# so let we start

#  Loops and patterns
#   For Loop

# print numbers from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

#    While Loop

# print numbers from 1 to 5
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

#   Nested Loop-Print a square pattern

# 5x5 star square
for i in range(5):
    for j in range(5):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()

#    Triangle pattern

# Right angled triangle
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("*" * i)

#    Number pattern

# Triangle of numbers
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, i+1):
        print(j, end=" ")
    print()


#   so my students I have a homework for you try and solve problems and follow me and reply me

#Print a table of any number (e.g., table of 7).

#Make a pyramid pattern with *.

#Print sum of first 10 natural numbers using a loop.

#Have fun.Happy coding
#Best of luck
# Keep smiling and always be happy :)
# byeeeeee :)
